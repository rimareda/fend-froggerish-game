## Instructions

- To run this game, first download all files locally, then run index.html in the browser of your choice.
- As gameplay is reliant on a keyboard's arrow keys, playing this game will not work without a physical keyboard.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to move Anakin across the board.
- Avoid the Obi-Wans moving horizontally across the board. Running into one will send you back to the starting position.
- The game ends (and you win) when Anakin reaches the lava at the top of the board.
